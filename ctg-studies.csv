NCT05603351,Prostate Cancer Screening With Abbreviated MRI Protocol,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05603351,ProstaPilot,RECRUITING,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the male population with incidence and mortality rates comparable to breast cancer in women, but in contrast, a population screening program that would fulfill all the recommended criteria is not yet available. According to international recommendations, the preventive PSA sampling used in clinical practice is not suitable because of the concurrent detection of clinically insignificant carcinomas in a major proportion of tests. These clinically non-significant cancers make up a significant and increasing proportion with age. Detection of non-significant cancers burdens the health care system and patients with the care that has no positive impact on their health. Current preventive serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing does not distinguish benign hyperplasia and nonsignificant carcinoma from clinically significant cancer. It is therefore not suitable for full-scale screening.

According to current guidelines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated only in patients with an increased risk of cancer for detection or staging after biopsy and is not used for screening. According to recent studies, MRI has detected an increased proportion of significant cancers in the general population compared to screening based on PSA, while fewer clinically insignificant cancers have been detected. In screening, a shorter examination protocol without contrast medium (biparametric MRI) is used with a lower cost per examination, allowing to increase both the number of patients examined and patient comfort.

The main objective of the project is to assess the contribution of imaging in the screening of clinically significant prostate cancer and to validate the published results in the Czech population, and extend the screening model by the second round of examinations and additional laboratory markers.

NCT05123300,PRISMA-PET - Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer With PSMA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05123300,,RECRUITING,"Early and correct diagnostic staging is paramount to keep patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer in the correct treatment tract to avoid under- and overdiagnosis in prostate cancer staging. With accurate staging, the investigators aim to save patients from side effects of insufficient or too extensive treatment. The investigators hypothesize that precise staging will lead to optimized individualized treatment and subsequently to prolonged survival and increased quality of life.

Prostate cancer is a very heterogeneous disease varying from indolent tumors to aggressive cancer types. About one-fifth of patients with newly detected high- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer present with bone metastases and their 3-years survival is less than 50%. Precise staging is required for planning relevant treatment that has the potential to increase survival.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and can serve as a target for precise diagnosis and staging. PSMA-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has shown to be more accurate than traditional imaging, but there is a need for prospective trials analyzing the impact of primary staging with PSMA-PET/CT on treatment planning and patient benefit.

In a prospective multicenter study, the investigators plan to include 448 patients and randomize 1:1 to either traditional imaging or PSMA-PET/CT. The investigators aim to analyze whether PSMA-PET/CT increases progression-free survival and quality of life.

NCT05326282,Evaluating the Role of Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05326282,ERUP,COMPLETED,"Active surveillance (AS) is becoming an increasingly common treatment option for men who have been diagnosed with localised low-grade prostate cancer (PCa). Low-grade disease is commonly noted by clinicians to be clinically insignificant cancer but remains a psychological burden to many men in this cohort. There is consensus that regular review is required for men on AS so that early treatment can be undertaken if there is disease progression, and to support men living with a cancer diagnosis. Some AS protocols, including National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), advocate the use of MRI as a regular part of the monitoring pathway.

Unfortunately, access to MRI for AS, within the current health care environment in the UK, is limited due to increasing demand for primary diagnostic examinations, particularly in the post pandemic recovery phase. Emerging technologies in ultrasound imaging may, however, add another diagnostic tool to monitor disease for patients on AS. This proof of concept study is to evaluate whether new multi-parametric ultrasound techniques can safely reduce the number of MRIs required for effective AS.

Men being investigated for PCa will be invited to undergo an ultrasound examination of their prostate, via the rectum, in addition to the diagnostic MRI undertaken as part of normal care. The findings of the ultrasound will be directly compared with the MRI and any subsequent biopsy samples taken as part of routine care. Those who then progress onto AS will be invited to undergo regular rectal prostate ultrasound examinations. These will be compared with previous imaging for signs of change.

However, certain types of cancers such as prostate, breast, kidney, and melanoma can have resistance to radiation, making treatment less successful. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a newer form of focused treatment that gives higher doses of radiation without damage to surrounding organs. It often is used to help control and cure disease, but less commonly as a way to palliate and treat symptoms. This study is looking at using SBRT for the purposes of improving pain caused by bone metastases in prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma patients. It is theorized that the higher levels of radiation may be able to combat the resistance some tumour cells have to radiotherapy and provide improved pain response to treatment.
