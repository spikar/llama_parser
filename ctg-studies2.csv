NCT04157088,"Study to Compare the Effects of Drug Darolutamide and Drug Enzalutamide on Physical Function, Including Balance and Daily Activity, in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04157088,DaroAcT,TERMINATED,"Researchers in this study want to compare the effects of drug darolutamide and drug enzalutamide on physical function, including balance and daily activity, in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Both darolutamide and enzalutamide are approved AR inhibitors used for the treatment of patients with CRPC. AR inhibitor is a substance that keeps androgens (male sex hormones) from binding to proteins called androgen receptors, which are found in normal prostate cells, some prostate cancer cells, and in some other cells. Preventing this binding blocks the effects of these hormones in the body and therefore keeps prostate cancer cells from growing. Patients participating this study will receive either darolutamide or enzalutamide tablets. To evaluate the physical function, patients will be asked to make some movements like rising from a chair, walking three meters, etc. Additionally, researchers also want to find out the survival of patients and if patients have fatigue (feeling tired), cognitive (learning and thinking) problems, or other medical problems during the trial.

The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion.

Due to an increased frequency and early onset of Grade≥3 hematological toxicity noted among the participants receiving 240 mg of Ceralsertib, the sponsor decreased the dose to 160mg.

HF are unpleasant paroxysmal episodes of flushing, sweating with vasodilation of the face, neck, and chest. These episodes can last for seconds to minutes and are often associated with night sweats, anxiety, and insomnia and have negative effects on quality of life.

Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) with local anesthetic may be an effective treatment of HF in men on ADT, but has not been studied in any published clinical trials.

The stellate ganglion is a neural structure in the anterior cervical spine region and is part of the sympathetic nervous system. It has been injected safely in the practice of pain management for more than 50 years in cases of post herpetic neuralgia (shingles), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and other painful neuropathies as well as some types of cardiac dysrhythmias.

Participants without an event (death) were censored at the date of last contact., From the first dose of study treatment to the date of death (maximum up to 5.2 years approximately)|Phase 2: Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of death. Participants without an event (death) were censored at the date of last contact., From the first dose of study treatment to the date of death (maximum up to 5.2 years approximately)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With PSA Response, PSA response was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed PSA decline \>=50% compared to baseline. PSA response was calculated as a decline from baseline PSA (ng/mL) to the maximal PSA response with a threshold of 50%. A PSA response must be confirmed by a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later., From baseline PSA (ng/mL) to the maximal PSA response with a threshold of 50% (maximum up to 5.2 years approximately)|Phase 1b: Percentage of Participants With CA-125 Response, Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) response is defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from baseline. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days., From baseline to at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 level (maximum up to 5.2 years approximately)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With CA-125 Response, CA-125 response is defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from baseline. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days., From baseline to at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 level (maximum up to 5.2 years approximately)|Number of Participants With Different Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Status at Baseline, PD-L1 expression on tumor and infiltrating immune cells were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-L1 expression level corresponds to the percentage of positive cells. The PD-L1 Positive category does not apply to cohorts A1 and A2. The PD-L1 High/Low categories only apply to cohorts A1 and A2. Participants were considered positive if their baseline tumor tissue sample demonstrated cell surface PD-L1 expression: 1) for Cohorts E1, E2, and F: \>=1% tumor cells (TC) or \>= 5% immune cells (IC); 2) for Cohort D: TC/IC\>=25%; 3) for Cohorts B1, B2, C1, C2: IC\>=5%; otherwise were considered negative. Categories based on PD-L1 expression level ≥50% and \<50% were defined as High and Low, respectively., At baseline (the last available assessment prior to the start of study treatment was defined as 'baseline' value or 'baseline' assessment)|Number of Participants With Different Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) at Baseline, TMB was defined as the total number of mutations in the tumor genome, or number of mutations per megabase of DNA if derived from targeted sequencing. High: TMB score \>=20 muts/mb (number of mutations per megabase of DNA); Medium: TMB score \>=10 muts/mb and \<20 muts/mb; Low: TMB score \<10 muts/mb., At baseline (the last available assessment prior to the start of study treatment was defined as 'baseline' value or 'baseline' assessment)|Number of Participants With Different DNA Damage Repair (DDR) Status at Baseline, DDR defect positive was determined by presence of one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in tissue, DNA and/or blood samples., At baseline (the last available assessment prior to the start of study treatment was defined as 'baseline' value or 'baseline' assessment)",,Pfizer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,223,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,B9991025|2017-001509-33|JAVELIN PARP MEDLEY,10/19/2017,2/22/2022,1/4/2023,11/6/2017,6/12/2023,10/13/2023,"Highlands Oncology Group, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Highlands Oncology, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Highlands Oncology Group, Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Highlands Oncology, Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Highlands Oncology Group, Springdale, Arkansas, 72762, United States|Highlands Oncology, Springdale, Arkansas, 72762, United States|Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, Beverly Hills, California, 90211, United States|Keck Hospital of USC, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|LAC+USC Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center/Investigational Drug Services, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Newport Beach, California, 92663, United States|Freidenrich Center for Translational Research (CTRU), Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Stanford Women's Cancer Center, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital Attn: Lalit Joshi, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital Attn: Svetlana Rashkova, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Attn: Vasilika Koci, PharmD, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|University Of Minesota Health: Clinics And Surgery Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|University of Minesota Medical Center, Fairview IDS Pharmacy, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Roswell Park Cancer Center Institute, Buffalo, New York, 14263, United States|NYU Investigational Pharmacy, New York, New York, 10016, United States|NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York, 10016, United States|NYU Langone Radiology, New York, New York, 10016, United States|NYU Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10016, United States|NYU Langone Radiology -
