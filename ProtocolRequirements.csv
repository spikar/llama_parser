,,,Section # & Headers in 2022 Template,Recommended Content,Sources,Instructions for extracting data from the sources (process/instruction flow from left to right across cells),,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"1. Across precedence protocols, hightlight common/similar content (in green) and unique content (in red). Take user inputs (see the first couple of pages in: https://b1healthcorp1-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ajay_behl_b1healthcorp_com/EYuQU4gJqKFPq1VuMh-ynUEBW8xQOQKaCqr6czdQvte_8A?e=gZgXdb) as part of prompts to present common and unique contents under ""common"" and ""unique"" headers. Checking for consistency across sections and therefore the generated document for consistency.
2. From the FDA/NIH 2022 template (https://b1healthcorp1-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ajay_behl_b1healthcorp_com/ESm0WxWlfeNImlBEWGLgM64BixPyGIMwyxEz4KSApv-l1g?e=Ua7wvq), show the guidance for each section or subsection.
3. Download (as citations with appropriate formatting) into the user’s citation bibliography database (e.g. see: https://www.zotero.org/ (open source). Also: “Zotero Connector” in the browser is a great extension to scrape information, including citations from a whole webpage of scholar.google.com. We can use it for our process/behind the scenes purposes and it can export the citations to any format of user's choice). Allow the user to insert the citations in the right place in the FASE platform. Look into using open source editors/Google Docs on how to have good editor capabilities within FASE, if possible. Else  export to different formats. To know about citation formats and downloads,search for a publication in scholar.google.com. For any of the search results, click on _“Cite_ under a result. 
4. For All sections and subsections, if no results turn up from the set of selected protocols, but there are other protocots in the DB that have that content (background search checks on the how many protocols and where within the protocols), prompt the user to see that specific content to supplement the current results.","Now: Precedence protocols, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, PubMed, publications. Later: EU Clinical Trial Registry, NCI and other trial registries, FDA.gov","GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: 1. For sections and subsections, by default, in addition to all the search term combinations mentioned in the specific rows also search for the FASE/FDA section/subsection header text. 2.In all cases, if a section/subsection is not available, return ""not available"".  3. The user would have also specified the {therapies} (including {intervention therapy}) and {mechanism of action} or {MOA} in the intervention or comparators. 4. For all sections and subsections: maintain the original source header (or indicate that it is from an unmarked paragraph) and show which FASE/FDA section/subsection it maps into. 5. ""/"" in all cases implies ""OR"" boolean operator",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY,,,"Search for ""clinical trial summary"", ""protocol summary"" ""synopsis"" as a section header.  If present, all content (including all subsections) resulting from the search has to be copied into subsection 1.1 (""protocol synopsis"") except what gets allocated to subsections 1.2 and 1.3 .
