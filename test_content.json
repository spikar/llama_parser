The course of prostate \ncancer from diagnosis to death is best categorized as a series of \nclinical stages based on the extent of disease, hormonal status, and \nabsence or presence of detectable metastases: localized disease, \nrising levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radiation \ntherapy or surgery with no detectable metastases, and clinical \nmetastases in the non-castrate or castrate stage.  Although surgery, \nradiation, or a combination of both can be curative for patients with \nlocalized disease, a significant proportion of these patients have \nrecurrent disease as evidenced by a rising level of PSA, which can \nlead to the development of metastases, especially in the high risk \ngroup – a transition to the lethal stage of the disease. \nAndrogen depletion is the standard treatment with a generally \npredictable outcome: decline in PSA, a period of stability in which \nthe tumor does not proliferate, followed by rising PSA and \nregrowth as castration-resistant disease.  Molecular profiling studies \nof castration-resistance prostate cancers commonly show increased \nandrogen receptor (AR) expression, which can occur through AR \ngene amplification or other mechanisms. \nARN-509 is a second-generation anti-androgen that binds directly \nto the ligand-binding domain of AR, impairing nuclear \ntranslocation and DNA binding.  ARN-509 binds AR with \n \ngreater affinity than bicalutamide, and induces partial or complete \ntumor regression in both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant \nhuman prostate cancer xenograft models. \nA Phase I/II study (Protocol ARN-509-001) was designed to assess \nthe safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of ARN-509 \nin men with CRPC.  The Phase I portion of the study has been \ncompleted and the Phase II is currently ongoing.  In the Phase II, a \ntotal of 97 patients were enrolled across 3 different patient \npopulation subsets: high risk NM-CRPC, treatment-naïve metastatic \n",
